Heal translator for GlusterFS
=============================

Introduction
------------

The **heal** translator is a new feature for [GlusterFS](http://gluster.org)
aimed to offer some support on healing operations to client side translators.

It is able to coordinate accesses to files being healed and arbitrate in cases
when multiple clients are trying to heal a single file. It does not know how to
heal a file but offers aids to the client side translators to simplify and
improve the healing process. Using its features, it is possible to heal the
data of a file without using locks on the file.


Important notes
---------------

**DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS**

This translator is experimental and currently it is **only intended for
developers**. The steps needed to get this translator running are quite complex
for an average user without programming knowledge. And if/when things go wrong
it may be difficult to understand what happened and how to solve the problem.

Once it matures, the installation and configuration will be much easier and it
will be ready for being used in production environments like any other
translator.


Requirements
------------

* Source code of GlusterFS 3.4.0 or later, configured, compiled and installed
* The [glusterfs-gfsys](https://forge.gluster.org/disperse/gfsys) library
* The [glusterfs-dfc](https://forge.gluster.org/disperse/dfc) translator is
  needed on all bricks


Installation
------------

* Configure, compile and install GlusterFS and glusterfs-gfsys
* ./autogen.sh
* ./configure --with-glusterfs=<path to glusterfs> --with-gfsys=<path to gfsys>
* make
* make install

This should leave the translator module into the same place where GlusterFS has
been installed.


Configuration
-------------

The vol file of each brick must be edited to add the heal translator at least
just below the locks translator (it won't work as expected if it is not placed
after the locks translator). However it's better to place it immediately on top
of the posix translator.

For example, on a standard brick configuration:

    volume heal-posix
        type storage/posix
        option directory /bricks/b01
        option volume-id 135c4934-0039-4d8e-8f80-92383be99831
    end-volume

    volume heal-access-control
        type features/access-control
        subvolumes heal-posix
    end-volume

    volume heal-locks
        type features/locks
        subvolumes heal-access-control
    end-volume

The heal translator is added between the posix and access-control translators:

    volume heal-posix
        type storage/posix
        option directory /bricks/b01
        option volume-id 135c4934-0039-4d8e-8f80-92383be99831
    end-volume

    volume heal-heal
        type features/heal
        subvolumes heal-posix
    end-volume

    volume heal-access-control
        type features/access-control
        subvolumes heal-heal
    end-volume

    volume heal-locks
        type features/locks
        subvolumes heal-access-control
    end-volume


Technical information
---------------------

When one client detects an inconsistency and decides to heal a file, it sends a
special request to the server protected by an inodelk/entrylk. Since the heal
translator is placed below the locks translator, only one of these requests can
arrive at any single moment. The first received heal request is allowed, and
any subsequent request is denied until the first one finishes or the client
disconnects. This guarantees that only one client will be sending heal requests.

Data heal requests can be sent without any locking bacause there would be only
one client doing it. These requests can arrive concurrently with a normal write
request. In these cases, the normal request takes precedence if the affected
areas overlap. Once a fragment of the file has been written by a normal request
after initiating the heal process, the translator ignores any healing data sent
to one of the already updated areas.


Known problems
--------------

The heal translator is not fully implemented yet and does not allow normal
writes to non-healed areas while a heal is in progress.

Code quality will need to be improved (some structural changes, code cleaning
and adding documentation).
